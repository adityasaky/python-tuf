<Purpose>
  sig provides a higher-level signature handling interface for tuf.updater,
  tuf.repository_lib, and tuf.developer_tool.  Lower-level functionality used
  here comes primarily from securesystemslib, tuf.roledb, and tuf.keydb.

<Public Functions>

    get_signature_status()
      Analyzes the signatures included in given role metadata that includes
      signatures, taking arguments that convey the expected keyids and
      threshold for those signatures (either directly or in the form of a
      rolename to look up in roledb), produces a report of the validity of the
      signatures provided in the metadata indicating whether or not they
      correctly sign the given metadata and whether or each signature is from
      an authorized key.

    verify()
      Verifies a full piece of role metadata, returning True if the given role
      metadata is verified (signed by at least enough correct signatures from
      authorized keys to meet the threshold expected for this metadata) and
      False otherwise.  It uses get_signature_status() to glean the status of
      each signature.

  # TODO: should probably be called get_status_of_signatures, plural?

  <Purpose>
    Given a signable role dictionary, analyzes the signatures included in it
    (signable['signatures']) as signatures over the other metadata included in
    it (signable['signed']).

    Returns a dictionary representing an analysis of the status of the
    signatures in <signable> (see below).  This is done based on the
    keyids expected to sign for the role.

    If <threshold> and <keyids> are provided:
      Uses argument <keyids> to determine which keys are authorized to sign,
      and returns the information along with the <threshold> provided.

    If <threshold> and <keyids> are NOT provided and <rolename> is a top-level
    role:
      Determines the threshold and keyids to use based on the currently trusted
      Root metadata's listing for role <rolename>.

    Why <threshold> and <keyids> are sometimes required:
      # TODO: <~> Ask the reviewer in the PR if the comments below are
      #           important or just in the way.
      Note that the reason that keyids and threshold can only automatically be
      determined for top-level roles (root, snapshot, timestamp, targets) is
      that top-level roles have unambiguous signature expectations: the
      expected keyids and threshold come only from trusted root metadata. 
      Therefore, if optional args <threshold> and <keyids> are not provided,
      the expected values can be taken from trusted Root metadata in
      tuf.roledb.  Delegated targets roles, on the other hand, may be the
      objects of multiple different delegations from different roles that can
      each have different keyid and threshold expectations, so it is not
      possible to deduce these without knowing the delegating role of interest.


  <Arguments>
    signable:
      A dictionary with a 'signatures' entry containing a list of signatures,
      and a 'signed' entry, containing role metadata.
      Specifically, <signable> must conform to tuf.formats.SIGNABLE_SCHEMA,
      and the 'signed' entry in <signable> must conform to
      tuf.formats.ANYROLE_SCHEMA.
      e.g.:
        {'signatures': [
            {'keyid': '1234ef...', 'sig': 'abcd1234...'}, ... ],
         'signed': { '_type': 'root', 'version': 3, ... }
        }

    rolename:     (required if <keyids> and <threshold> are not provided)
      The name of the TUF role whose metadata is provided.
      If specified, this must conform to tuf.formats.ROLENAME_SCHEMA.
      e.g.: 'root', 'targets', 'some_delegated_rolename', ...
      This will be used to look up the required keyids and threshold to use,
      from the currently trusted Root metadata's listing by role.

    threshold:    (required for delegated targets roles)
      If specified, this must match tuf.formats.THRESHOLD_SCHEMA.  If provided
      along with <keyids>, this will be the information in the 'threshold'
      entry of the returned dictionary.

    keyids:       (required for delegated targets roles)
      If specified, this must conform to tuf.formats.KEYIDS_SCHEMA.  If
      provided along with <threshold>, this defines which keys can provide
      "good" signatures over the metadata.


  <Returns>
    Returns a dictionary representing the status of the signatures in
    <signable>, conforming to tuf.formats.SIGNATURESTATUS_SCHEMA.  The
    dictionary values are lists of keyids corresponding to signatures in
    <signable>, broken down under these dictionary keys:

      good_sigs:
          keyids corresponding to verified signatures over the role by keys
          trusted to sign over the role

      bad_sigs:
          keyids corresponding to invalid signatures over the role

      unknown_sigs:
          keyids (from signatures in <signable>) from unknown keys; i.e.,
          keyids that had no entry in tuf.keydb.

      untrusted_sigs:
          keyids corresponding to correct signatures over the role, by known
          keys (i.e. in tuf.keydb) that are nonetheless not authorized to sign
          over the role.
          (Authorization is based on either the <keyids> argument if provided,
          or, if not provided, Root metadata, as discussed below.)

      unknown_signing_scheme:
          keyids corresponding to signatures that list a signing scheme that is
          not supported.


  <Exceptions>
    securesystemslib.exceptions.UnknownRoleError
      if <rolename> is not a known role in the repository.

    tuf.exceptions.FormatError
      if <signable>, <rolename>, or <repository_name> are not formatted
        correctly,
      or if <threshold> is provided and not formatted correctly
      or if <threshold> is not provided but determined from trusted Root
        metadata yet somehow formatted incorrectly there.

    securesystemslib.exceptions.FormatError
      if <keyids> is provided but not formatted correctly,
      or if <repository_name> is not formatted correctly.

    tuf.exceptions.Error
      if <threshold> is provided but <keyids> is not, or vice versa,
      of if we have no way of determining the right keyids and threshold to use
        in verification -- specifically, if rolename is not the name of a
        top-level role and <keyids> and <threshold> arguments are not provided.


  <Side Effects>
    None.
